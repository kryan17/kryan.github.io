<h3> Art Deco </h3>
You are an architect. Appearances are everything, so you always wear a smart three-piece suit accompanied by a bowler derby hat, with a pencil behind your ear and a tape measure tucked somewhere. Think angular.

<h3> Bebop B'Doo </h3>
You are a jazz pianist. You have a penchant for blue suits matched with bowties or cufflinks bearing musical symbols. You wear glasses for reading sheet music, and carry a harmonica or tuning fork to ensure you're pitch perfect. 

<h3> Booboo B'Doo </h3>
You are a jazz singer. Long satin gloves, sparkling headband, and a necklace of pearls complement the blue evening gown you wear to sing. Don't forget your microphone! 

<h3> Casey Stumbles </h3>
You are the butler. You like wearing a uniform and for butlering, a tails suit, polished shoes and cufflinks suffice. An old pocket watch is your go-to timepiece and it fits snugly in your breast pocket along with a folded handkerchief for any emergency. 

<h3> Chyna Balloons </h3> 
You are a dancer. You like wearing dresses that accenture your leg movements, with tassels or sequins that ripple to the music. A feather headband completes the look, along with a white balloon if you're in the mood. 

<h3> Clea Du Boudoir </h3>
You are the maid. You wear your maid's uniform of a black dress covered in a white apron. Your hair is tucked up under a white cap and your lace-up boots are practical but smart. You carry a duster at all times. 

<h3> Farley Hatpin </h3>
You are a famous actor and director. You're dressed in a three-piece suit with bowler hat and cane like you've just walked off a film set. The top is tight and untucked, the trousers baggy, the shoes too big- but the moustache is just right!

<h3> Gray Catsby </h3>
You are a rich bachelor. With your black suede dinner jacket, white shirt and bowtie, you exude success and sophistication. A white handkerchief triangle peeks out of your breast pocket and you're always holding a stylish cane or monocle. 

<h3> Greta Garbled </h3>
You are a famous actress. If you're not wearing your hair up in a sequin pinned scarf, your permed playful ringlets bounce on your delicate chiffon dress. Shaded eyes and dark red lips complete the look. 

<h3> Halliday Inn </h3>
You are a hotel heiress. You like to be the center of attention and will wear anything as long as it's covered in gold and pearls (although you prefer a simple black hairband). The stripes on your dress represent the many floors of your family's hotel empire. 

<h3> Harvey Wallbanger </h3>
You are the smoothie maker. Mixing drinks can be hazardous work so you wear your shirt sleeves rolled up with a white cloth over your shoulder to catch any spillages from the smoothie shaker you're always carrying. Black braces complete your look. 

<h3> Knuckles Baloney </h3>
You are a club owner. You like wearing a pinstripe suit and trilby hat (with a white ribbon, obviously) along with polished, two-tone black and white shoes. You've also inked 'LOVE' and 'HATE' on your respective knuckles. 

<h3> Sydney Hilton </h3>
You are a party girl. Your short blonde hair is fashionably permed and complemented by a braided tiara. You're a big fan of Wedgewood and wear blue or green dresses that match your rings, brooch, and necklace- but not your black armband. 

<h3> Toots Mahoney </h3>
You are a club manager. As a fashion lover, you're happiest wearing pinstripe dresses with a mock feather boa and a trilby hat to show you can be one of the boys too.
