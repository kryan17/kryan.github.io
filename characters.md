<h3> Art Deco </h3>
You are an architect. Appearances are everything, so you always wear a smart three-piece suit accompanied by a bowler derby hat, with a pencil behind your ear and a tape measure tucked somewhere. Think angular.

<h3> Bebop B'Doo </h3>
You are a jazz pianist. You have a penchant for blue suits matched with bowties or cufflinks bearing musical symbols. You wear glasses for reading sheet music, and carry a harmonica or tuning fork to ensure you're pitch perfect. 

<h3> Booboo B'Doo </h3>
You are a jazz singer. Long satin gloves, sparkling headband, and a necklace of pearls complement the blue evening gown you wear to sing. Don't forget your microphone! 

<h3> Casey Stumbles </h3>
You are the butler. You like wearing uniform and for butlering, a tails suit, polished shoes and cufflinks suffice. An old pocket watch is your go-to timepiece and it fits snugly in your breast pocket along with a folded handkerchief for any emergency. 

<h3> Chyna Balloons </h3> 
You are a dancer. You like wearing dresses that accenture your leg movements, with tassels or sequins that ripple to the music. A feather headband completes the look, along with a white balloon if you're in the mood. 

<h3> Clea Du Boudoir </h3>
You are the maid. You wear your maid's uniform of a black dress covered in a white apron. Your hair is tucked up under a white cap and your lace-up boots are practical but smart. You carry a duster at all times. 

<h3> Farley Hatpin </h3>
You are a famous actor and director. You're dressed in a three-piece suit with bowler hat and cane like you've just walked off a film set. The top is tight and untucked, the trousers baggy, the shoes too big- but the moustache is just right!

<h3> Gray Catsby </h3>
You are a rich bachelor. With your black suede dinner jacket, white shirt and bowtie, you exude success and sophistication. A white handkerchief triangle peeks out of your breast pocket and you're always holding a stylish cane or monocle.
