<h3> Art Deco </h3>
You are an architect. Appearances are everything, so you always wear a smart three-pieve suit accompanied by a bowler derby hat, with a pencil behind your ear and a tape measure tucked somewhere. Think angular.

<h3> Bebop B'Doo </h3>
You are a jazz pianist. You have a penchant for blue suits matched with bowties or cufflinks bearing musical symbols. You wear glasses for reading sheet music, and carry a harmonica or tuning fork to ensure you're pitch perfect. 

<h3> Booboo B'Doo </h3>
You are a jazz singer. Long satin gloves, sparkling headband, and a necklace of pearls complement the blue evening gown you wear to sing. Don't forget your microphone!
