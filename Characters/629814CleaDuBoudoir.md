<h1> Clea du Boudoir Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Clea’s Bio </h3>
<p> You are a working class maid from humble beginnings and, as such, are enormously fortunate to have landed yourself a position in the service of Gray Catsby – on tof the richest men in the country. You work hard but you can’t complain, as he treats you well and you get to attend lots of fancy parties (albeit serving guests). Still, maybe one day your luck will change… </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>
<p> My name’s Clea du Boudoir and I’m Mr. Catsby’s maid. My father was French and sometimes I slip into the accent, among other things. I’m not really used to mixing with glamorous, beautiful people like yourselves so I hope you’ll excuse me and my poor manners. I can’t believe what’s happened. Poor Ms. Catsby! I didn’t know Miss Whiskers very well but she was always very kind to me. </p>

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>
<p>Gray Catsby is the only family you have. H e had even provided for you in his will – until Ginger Whiskers showed up… </p>


<h2> Act One – The Dumb Waiter </h2>

__If asked if you use the dumbwaiter say:__
<p> I use it every day! I couldn’t lug all those plates and dishes up to the dining room for breakfast, lunch, and dinner without it. Whose idea was it to put the dining room on the first floor anyways? Maybe if it had been downstairs, then Miss Whiskers would still be alive! It is an ‘elf and safety matter.  </p>
  
__If asked when you were last in the dining room, if you're INNOCENT say:__

<p> Just after four o’clock, I was in the servants area rummaging through my drawers. There was no one else in there. I got the table all set up nicely ready for dinner, as I usually do, and I haven’t been in there since. I’ve been too busy taking care of the guests, who have been acting very strangely. </p>

__If asked when you were last in the dining room, if you're GUILTY say:__

<p> Just after two o’clock. I cleared the lunch things away and washed them all up downstairs so they’d be ready for dinner. Since then, too busy taking care of the guests, who have been acting very strangely. </p>

<h2> Act Two – The Poor Maid </h2>

__If asked about the private papers you found, say:__

<p>It was not my fault. When Mr. Catsby has guests at the Hall, I have to pay special attention to the area under his bed. The things I have seen and removed, so that he does not get in trouble- I cannot tell you! But whilst I was cleaning away a blonde wig and a half-eaten Bockwurst, I noticed his Last Will and Testament lying there underneath it all. Well, a version of it in any case…  </p>
  
__If asked what had changed in the will, say:__

<p>I’m not sure I should say, because I know what you’re all going to think. Mr. Catsby had changed it so that all his money and fortune would go to Miss Whiskers. Before that, some of it was going to me and the butler. We’re like family, you see. But I don’t care about money and I’d never kill anyone over a few pounds!  </p>
<h2> Act Three – The Angry Chef </h2>

__If asked if you were in the kitchen today, say:__

<p>To be honest, I do my best to stay out of Chef Cleaver’s way. He scares me, the way he shouts and screams at everyone, waving his enormous knife around. And the language! The air is so blue I’m surprised the mashed potatoes have not taken on the same color. Talking of that, why isn’t he a suspect? I suppose there must be a good reason. Anyways, I have not been in the kitchen at all today. I’ve not even had a break.  </p>

__If asked where you were at the time of the murder, if you’re INNOCENT say:__

<p>I was busy working! Just because the dinner table was set, doesn’t mean m work was done. Mr. Catsby has me endless polishing everything, and not just the silverware. </p>
  
__If asked where you were at the time of the murder, if you’re GUILTY say:__

<p> I was busy working! Mr. Catsby has me endless polishing everything, and not just the silverware. Honestly, my legs feel like I’ve climbed fifty mountains what with all those stairs. </p>

<h2> End Game </h2>

__If you're INNOCENT say:__

<p>It was obviously not me, I am just the chambermaid. Imagine the mess I will have to clean up! I’m upset I’ve been dropped from the Will, but it may be just an oversight. I would not kill my employer’s fiancée. If it’s not in my job description, I don’t do it! </p>

__If you're GUILTY, wait until last to say:__

<p>Thank goodness, I cannot bear the guilt any longer. I never dreamed I could kill anyone in cold blood, but when I found out Mr. Catsby was cutting me from his Will.. it wasn’t just about the money, you see= my feelings were hurt too. All this time, me and Mr. Catsby and the rest of his staff, we’ve been like family. He’s always looked out for us and he told me years ago that he’d left me something in his Will. So to be cut out like that when Ginger Whiskers came along, well, that took the biscuit! I liked about not being in the kitchen today. I think I let slip, when I said I’d washed the dishes- I had to be in the kitchen to do that! That’s when I pocketed the ice pick. Then, when I was setting the table for dinner just after five, miss Whiskers came into the dining room. Something just came over me. I pushed her into the dumbwaiter and stabbed her in the back. Then I stuffed her arms and legs in and shut the door. It all happened so quickly. I ran back to my room to change my clothes before resuming my duties. I do hope Mr Catsby can forgive me… </p>
