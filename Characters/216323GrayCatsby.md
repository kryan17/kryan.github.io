<h1> Gray Catsby Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Gray’s Bio </h3>
<p> Easy come, easy go- that’s your motto. And it’s served you well so far, having lost – and regained – your fortune several times already (thanks to your erratic poker skills). You have yet to work a day in your life, and prefer to pass the time drinking cocktails, flirting harmlessly with young ladies, and laughing loudly with your head thrown back while a champagne cork pops in the background. </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>
<p>Well you all know me, Gray Catsby, and if you don’t, what are you doing in my house?! Tonight was supposed to be about music, and moonlight, and love, and romance – I didn’t kill her, no chance! Ginger Whiskers was my beloved finance. There’s a gingery whiskered shaped hole in my heart now. Still, there’s no reason you shouldn’t enjoy yourselves, unless you’re the killer of course. You may murder my guests, but you may never murder my evening! </p>

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>
<p>Your engagement to Ginger Whiskers was not the fine romance you’d hoped for and you suspected she had an ulterior motive for wanting to marry you… </p>


<h2> Act One – Old Sport </h2>

__If asked why you're not more upset say:__
<p>Oh, I’m just putting on a brave face for everyone. I’m devastate about Ginger really. I loved that girl more than a forced backhand lob down the line. Did I mention I used to play professional tennis? I was at the top of my game but I gave it all up for Daisy – sorry, I mean Ginger. Daisy is an old flame. I don’t know what I said her name. It must be the shock kicking in. </p>
  
__If asked what Daisy's got to do with it, say:__
<p>Nothing, nothing at all. Daisy and I were engaged a long time ago- two, maybe three months! But she died suddenly when the scarf she was wearing got tangled in a ceiling fan. She was trying to change a lightbulb at the time. It was so tragic…    </p>

<h2> Act Two – Old Money </h2>

__If asked if Ginger was after your money, if you're INNOCENT say:__
<p>Before today, I’d have thumped you for saying such a thing. Now I’m not so sure. I suppose all the signs were there. When I asked her to marry me, she wouldn’t say yes until I showed her the ring. And the sales receipt for it. Daisy never did that. </p>
  
__If asked if Ginger was after your money, if you're GUILTY say:__
<p> I hope not. I lost all my money in a poker game last week. This party was my last hurrah. I haven’t eaten in two days just so I could pay the bartender, and I’m moving back in with my parents tomorrow. I hadn’t told Ginger but I don’t think she’d have minded. She was a rock throughout the whole Daisy debacle. </p>

__If asked whether Ginger knew Daisy say:__
<p> Not much. But Ginger knew me and, by strange coincidence, Ginger was the one that found Daisy on that fateful day. She wasn’t fazed at all. Amazing!  </p>

<h2> Act Three – Old Spice </h2>

__If asked whether Ginger killed Daisy, if you’re INNOCENT say:__
<p>No, no she didn’t. Can we stop talking about Daisy’s death? This is Ginger’s death now, let her have her turn. </p>
  
__If asked whether Ginger killed Daisy, if you’re GUILTY say:__
<p>Who told you that? She told me it was an accident – that she’d asked Daisy to change the bulb. Some may say it was more like criminal negligence. If you knew what a klutz Daisy was, coupled with her wearing such a long wispy scarf, you’d have kept her away from anything that remotely resembled a propeller blade. </p>

__If asked where you were when Ginger was killed, if you’re INNOCENT say:__
<p>I was in the projection room watching Farley Hatpin’s new file – we decided to have a bit of an impromptu screening. To be honest, it was a bit of a shocker but you’ve got to support the old boy haven’t you? In hindsight, it was about a man who falls for a gold-digging harlot so that hasn’t helped.  </p>

__If asked where you were when Ginger was killed, if you’re GUILTY say:__
<p>I’d rather not say – it’s a little embarrassing. But if you must know... I had a rather rich curry at the Taj Mahal last night and it has been plaguing me all day. I thought I’d seen the last of it this morning but then we decided to have an impromptu screening of Farley Hatpin’s new film and I had a very strong urge to vomit just after it started so I had to leave. Thankfully it’s passed now. No, wait – perhaps not. Would you excuse me?</p>


<h2> End Game </h2>

__If you're INNOCENT say:__
<p>Of course I didn’t kill my fiancée, that would be ludicrous! I’d sometimes think Ginger was only after me for my money but that’s what watertight pre-nuptials are for. I’ll miss her little whiskers brushing against my face in the morning, even her snoring was like purring. </p>

__If you're GUILTY, wait until last to say:__
<p>Where do I begin? With Daisy’s murder? That’s right – I said Daisy… and _murder._ Perhaps murder is too strong a word, but Ginger knew what she was doing when she asked Daisy to change that light bulb. Especially as she switched on the ceiling fan with Daisy half-akimbo. After that, Ginger was all over me and I didn’t discourage her. I was feeling sorry for myself and frankly, I enjoyed the company – but the more time I spent with Ginger, the more I suspected Daisy’s death wasn’t an accident. Was Ginger after my money? Probably, but who cares what her reasons were? The fact remains that without Ginger’s scheming, Daisy would still be alive. So – this whole soiree was just part of my plan – a mere diversion so that I could kill Ginger and frame someone else. The ice pick was already in my pocket before any of you arrived. As for opportunity – I’d already old you that I hadn’t eaten for two days so I’m surprised you fell for my story about the bad curry. I didn’t lie about losing all my money however, so if any of you could spot me legal counsel, I’d be most grateful. Normally I’d just pay someone else to take the fall for me…  </p>
