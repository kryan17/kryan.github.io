<h1> Bebop B’Doo Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Bebop’s Bio </h3>

<p> Encouraged to play the piano from the age of five, you were somewhat of a maestro by twelve. Unfortunately, there wasn’t much money in the whole classical side of things, but music halls and clubs were paying big money to get live acts in, so you decided to concentrate on that. Your partner, Booboo, responded to an advert in the local newspaper for a singer – and she’s been your other half even since. </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>

<p>I’m Bebop B’Doo, jazz pianist at your service. I was scheduled to perform here with my wife tonight, and we’re happy to still play on, but either way we’ll be expecting to get paid. Ginger hired us originally, but surely someone is going to foot the bill? I’m not sure why I’m a suspect- I took a long walk outside before dinner and didn’t see anyone. Who fancies a game of poker while we’re waiting? </p>

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>
<p> You’re flat broke thanks to a gambling addiction. Ginger promised to pay you for tonight but later told you she’d donated your fee to charity… </p>


<h2> Act One – Odds Off </h2>
__If asked about a gambling addition say:__

<p> I don’t have a gambling addition! I’m as addicted to gambling as you are to oxygen – meaning I can’t live without it and I need it all the time. That came out wrong – a lot like most of my bets. </p>
  
__If asked if you’ve made money say:__
<p> Not yet, but with gambling you’re only really lost when you stop. I’m way way down but I’ve not cashed out yet, so I’ll win it back soon. The only thing that keeps us afloat is getting paid for these gigs, so I’ll ask again, who’s paying us? </p>

<h2> Act Two – Altruism </h2>

__If asked about your donation say:__

<p>That wasn’t a donation. Ms Whiskers promised to pay us a large fee for performing tonight to encourage people to empty their wallets. When we turned up, she informed me she’d donated all of our fee to charity. That wasn’t my donation, it was hers. I still want my money! </p>
  
__If asked about leaving the donation, if you're INNOCENT say:__
<p>I suppose so. We’re flat broke and likely to lose our house but I guess those underprivileged children will never get to experience the opera without charities like this. We should probably leave soon anyways. I wasn’t anywhere near the kitchen today – you can ask Chef Cleaver. </p>

__If asked about leaving the donation, if you're GUILTY say:__

<p>I hate to labor the point, but it wasn’t my donation. Now, if someone could write me out a cheque, I’ll be on my way. A small number is absolutely fine as long are there are a few zeroes after it. This is the second time somebody has pulled a murder to try and get out of paying us and it’s got to stop. I’ve a mind to keep those bottles of champagne I liberated from the kitchen earlier. </p>

<h2> Act Three – Ring the Killer </h2>
__If asked about having the engagement ring, say:__
<p> Er, yes, I do have Ms. Whiskers engagement ring on me. I guess that does look pretty suspicious. Once I told her about having a bounty on my head, she promised to pay me for tonight and handed over her ring as security. I was going to give it back once I’d been paid, naturally.

__If asked having a bounty, if you’re INNOCENT say:__
<p>I lied to Ms. Whisker about the bounty to get her to feel bad about donation our fee to charity. I did once owe ‘Knee-breaker’ Neil some money and he didn’t think I was going to pay it back so he put out a bounty for me. But I settled that debt by playing a set at his daughter’s wedding reception. </p>
  
__If asked having a bounty, if you’re GUILTY say:__
<p> When you gamble as much as me you’re bound to pick up a few debts, bounties, and death threats. I owe ‘Knee-breaker’ Neil some cash, about the amount I was supposed to be paid for this gig, so that bounty will get called off as soon as someone pays me. This is getting a bit ridiculous. I know that our original fee was donated by when I talked to Ginger about it in the dining room, she assured me that the great Mr. Catsby would pay me and handed over her ring as security. So where is my money?  </p>


<h2> End Game </h2>

__If you're INNOCENT say:__
<p>I didn’t do it. I know it’s suspicious I’ve got the engagement ring, but I really as walking outside during the time of the murder and aside from the issue of non-payment, had no grudges against Ms. Whiskers. I just hope that Catsby’s not the killer – otherwise I’ll never get paid! </p>

__If you're GUILTY, wait until last to say:__
<p>Well played. So I wasn’t taking a long walk outside. I was having a grand argument with the Ginger “whinger” in the dining room. But she had it coming. You don’t just donate a desperate man’s fee to charity without asking his permission! I know it’s the 1920s but what makes people think they can just listen to music without paying the musicians? She as adamant that the donation would stand so I thought of another way to get paid- her diamond rock of an engagement ring. She wouldn’t had it over without a fight, obviously, btu that ended quickly when I pulled out the ice pick. I though it might come in handy when I was stealing the champagne earlier. So yes, I am the murder, congratulations. That aside, there is still this small issue of payment that needs to be resolved before I turn myself over to the authorities. Anyone? Don’t make me come and get it… </p>
