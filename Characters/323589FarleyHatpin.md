<h1> Farley Hatpin Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Farley’s Bio </h3>

<p> You started out performing Shakespeare behind a shop window but later realized nobody could hear you, so began to exaggerate your gestures for applause. This drew even bigger crowds and so you began your career as a silent film actor. You met Catsby when he financed one of your films and have remained friends ever since. He can’t stand your silent phone calls though. </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>

<p> I’m Farley Hatpin – actor, director and yes, this is what my voice sounds like. It’s a crying shame what’s happened to Ginger, such a lovely girl. I still remember the party where I first saw her. Such talent. Anyhow, the show must go on, as they say in the theatre, and I’m starving – so can we hurry up and find the murderer so we can eat? </p>

<h2> Act One – Awfuldontist </h2>

__If asked about your tooth pick say:__

<p> It’s nothing strange, I just pick my teeth with an ice pick occasionally- it all depends on what I’ve been eating. If I recall correctly I did use an ice pick today, but I’m sure I returned it to the kitchen afterwards – isn’t it there? </p>
  
__If asked how you knew Ginger say:__

<p> I had the pleasure of making her acquaintance at a charades party many years ago but I didn’t really get to know her until she started up with Catsby. I have absolutely no idea why anyone would want to kill her. </p>

<h2> Act Two – Give Us a Clue </h2>
  
__If asked about Ginger’s charade, if you're INNOCENT say:__

<p> The first time I met Ginger she was performing a charade that, well, was very much like something I did in the past that shall remain a very dark secret. I was shocked so I quizzed her about it, but she was nonplussed. She said her charade was pulling a cat through a toilet roll in a sea of jelly, but it did so look like the action of one Farley Hatpin doing something he much regrets now.  </p>

__If asked about Ginger’s charade, if you're GUILTY say:__

<p> How does everyone know about this? I should kill you all! Sorry. Over-reacting as per normal. The first time I met Ginger she was performing a charade that, well, was very much like something I did in the past that shall remain a very dark secret. I was shocked so I quizzed her about it, but she was nonplussed. She said her charade was pulling a cat through a toilet roll in a sea of jelly, but it did so look like the action of one Farley Hatpin doing something he much regrets now.  </p>

__If asked about your dark secret say:__

<p> I will never reveal my dark secret. I take it to the grave. I can, however, perform a small charade that may enlighten you. </p> 
<p> [ACTION: perform a charade attempting to pull a cat through a toilet roll in a sea of jelly] </p>


<h2> Act Three – The Tramp </h2>

__If asked if you watched your own film, if you’re INNOCENT say:__

<p>I was of course operating the projector in the projector room showing my latest movie. I do recall sitting next to a couple of you during the film and answering questions at the end. Where did you think I was, in the dining room? </p>
  
__If asked if you watched your own film, if you’re GUILTY say:__

<p> I’m afraid I had to miss that, as I was in the gentleman’s room purging all the food I’d eaten today. When I get nervous I eat, and when I eat I get nervous. I’m still full to the brim now and couldn’t even manage a wafer-thin mint, unless one was offered to me in the next ten seconds. I didn’t see anyone else in the toilet with me, which is probably for the best.  </p>

__If asked if you killed Ginger to keep your dark secret safe, if you’re INNOCENT say:__

<p>That’s a good theory, but on the basis I didn’t kill Ginger that question is completely redundant. My dark secret is safe but even if it wasn’t, it’s not worth killing for. There was a mouse, some Pinot Grigio, and a ping pong ball involved but I’ll say no more.  </p>

__If asked if you killed Ginger to keep your dark secret safe, if you’re GUILTY say:__

<p> Did I not just mime out my dark secret for you all to see? For all I know, considering the enormous amount of talent I possess, most of you probably already know what myd ark secret is. And just in case there’s any doubt, I can confirm it did also involve a gerbil, some duct tape and a firework. I say no more.  </p>
