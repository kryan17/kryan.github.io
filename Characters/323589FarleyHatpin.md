<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Farley’s Bio </h3>

<p> You started out performing Shakespeare behind a shop window but later realized nobody could hear you, so began to exaggerate your gestures for applause. This drew even bigger crowds and so you began your career as a silent film actor. You met Catsby when he financed one of your films and have remained friends ever since. He can’t stand your silent phone calls though. </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>

<p> I’m Farley Hatpin – actor, director and yes, this is what my voice sounds like. It’s a crying shame what’s happened to Ginger, such a lovely girl. I still remember the party where I first saw her. Such talent. Anyhow, the show must go on, as they say in the theatre, and I’m starving – so can we hurry up and find the murderer so we can eat? </p>
