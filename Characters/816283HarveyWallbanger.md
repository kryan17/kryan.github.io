<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Harvey's Bio </h3>
You always wanted to be a chemist but unfortunately your grades didn’t agree. To support yourself flunking university, you work as a bartender and it became your fallback when all other options failed. You amuse yourself by inventing new cocktails and naming them after you, like the “Harvey Wallbanger”. You also invented “Anything Mojitos” and the “Flappertini”. 

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>
I’m Harvey the drinks mixer – also known as the barman. Poor Ginger- or as I know her, Gin & Tonic. I’ve been glued to the bar all day. Serving drinks isn’t just about filling glasses. Charm, wit, and repartee-strange names for my siblings I know, but they taught me how to look into a man’s soul or a woman’s clutch and know immediately how to quench their thirst. Ginger was G&T: relaxing, sophisticated, and welcoming. The butler, however, likes an Old Fashioned served in a tumbler. Why do you think that is? Because h’s old fashioned and he tumbles- am I right? 

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>

__If asked whether there’s an ice pick behind the bar, say:__
<p> I do normally carry an ice pick with me, it’s one of the tools of the trade, but I was told everything would be provided for me at Catsby Hall- which it was. The ice pick and a plentiful supply of ice are both kept in the kitchen. 
  
__If asked whether you’ve been in the kitchen today, if you’re INNOCENT say:__
Er, no. When I said I’ve been behind the bar all day it means exactly that. I haven’t left my post. Yes, the door to the kitchen is behind the bar by Chef Cleaver has been bringing the ice through to me all day. Go and ask him. 

__If asked whether you’ve been in the kitchen today, if you’re GUILTY say:__
Of course I have, the door to the kitchen is behind the bar so I can fetch ice and water for your every whim. I’m not going to be very popular serving warm drinks, am I? I took a toilet break sometime after 5pm too, is that allowed?
