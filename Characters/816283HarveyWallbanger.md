<h1> Harvey Wallbanger Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Harvey's Bio </h3>
You always wanted to be a chemist but unfortunately your grades didn’t agree. To support yourself flunking university, you work as a bartender and it became your fallback when all other options failed. You amuse yourself by inventing new cocktails and naming them after you, like the “Harvey Wallbanger”. You also invented “Anything Mojitos” and the “Flappertini”. 

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>
I’m Harvey the drinks mixer – also known as the barman. Poor Ginger- or as I know her, Gin & Tonic. I’ve been glued to the bar all day. Serving drinks isn’t just about filling glasses. Charm, wit, and repartee-strange names for my siblings I know, but they taught me how to look into a man’s soul or a woman’s clutch and know immediately how to quench their thirst. Ginger was G&T: relaxing, sophisticated, and welcoming. The butler, however, likes an Old Fashioned served in a tumbler. Why do you think that is? Because h’s old fashioned and he tumbles- am I right? 

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>
You like to think you’re a ladies man but when Ginger turned down on of your passes, it made you very, very, angry … 


<h2> Act One - Hot & Cold Drinks </h2>

__If asked whether there’s an ice pick behind the bar, say:__
<p> I do normally carry an ice pick with me, it’s one of the tools of the trade, but I was told everything would be provided for me at Catsby Hall- which it was. The ice pick and a plentiful supply of ice are both kept in the kitchen. </p>
  
__If asked whether you’ve been in the kitchen today, if you’re INNOCENT say:__
<p> Er, no. When I said I’ve been behind the bar all day it means exactly that. I haven’t left my post. Yes, the door to the kitchen is behind the bar by Chef Cleaver has been bringing the ice through to me all day. Go and ask him. </p>

__If asked whether you’ve been in the kitchen today, if you’re GUILTY say:__
<p> Of course I have, the door to the kitchen is behind the bar so I can fetch ice and water for your every whim. I’m not going to be very popular serving warm drinks, am I? I took a toilet break sometime after 5pm too, is that allowed? </p>

<h2> Act Two – Punch Drunk </h2>

__If asked about poisoning Ginger, say:__
<p> I don’t think so. Yes, my mixes can be potent, but only in a fun “room-spinning-can’t-hold-in-your-dinner” kind of way. It’s not poison though. It’s alcohol, isn’t it. It’s good for you! </p>
  
__If asked how much Ginger drank say:__
<p> She’d had three G&Ts since this morning. She was worried about getting everything right for Catsby, who’d drunk three times before breakfast. I’m no doctor, but I’d wager her alcohol had burned off well before 5pm today. I don’t think that’s to blame. </p>

<h2> Act Three – Ginger Schnapps </h2>

__If asked about making a pass at Ginger, say:__
<p> Stead on everyone! I’m a barman, it’s my job to make people feel special. Ginger’s such a happy flapper, I just felt the moment was right to move in for a smooch. Seems she wasn’t ready to misbehave and anything didn’t go. She turned me down, which is a first for me- and hopefully a last. </p>
  
__If asked where you did it, if you’re INNOCENT say:__
<p> It was late afternoon at the bar. Ginger had asked me to pour her fourth G&T. I remember clearly because she threw that one over me, which is how I knew she’d only have three drinks in total today. In hindsight, I probably should have made my move before pouring the drink. Needless to say, I poured myself a large Flappertini, which is sort of a Martini mixed with a Flapper. Don’t ask me what’s in a Flapper- that’s a secret I’ll never tell! </p>
__If asked where you did it, if you’re GUILTY say:__
<p> She was, um, alone in the gardens. I saw her through the window from the bar and she looked freezing cold, so I went out and offered her my jacket, which she accepted. I took that as the ‘anything goes’ signal and swooped in with a smacker. I’ve never been rejected before in my entire life so I was a bit stunned. Needless to say, I beat a hasty retreat back to the bar and poured myself a large Flappertini, which is sort of a Martini mixed with a Flapper. Don’t ask me what’s in a Flapper- that’s a secret I’ll never tell!  </p>
