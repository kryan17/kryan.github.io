<h1> Greta Garbled Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Greta’s Bio </h3>
<p>Who is Greta Garbled? A doting wife, a spy, a femme fatale? You play so many roles, the real Greta has been somewhat lost. But one thing’s for sure- you’re always glamorous, always mysterious, and always just out of reach.. you’re so Hollywood, dahling, they might as well change the name to Gretawood!  </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>
<p>Dahlings, please, let’s not make a fuss. Yes, I’m Greta Garbled – famous star of the silver screen. I was in the area to attend the premiere of my latest film, “The Maltese Icepick”, so naturally I had to visit my dear, dear friend ray Catsby. We’ve known each other for years. Poor Gray! Ginger seemed like such a well kid. “Maybe she had it coming, maybe she didn’t – but it had turned up nonetheless and it was everywhere.” That’s a line from my film. </p>

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>
<p>You live a lonely existence, courted by many, cared for by few. Only Gray Catsby looked after you, which is why you are so hopelessly smitten with him…  </p>


<h2> Act One – The Script </h2>

__If asked what your film is about say:__
<p>I play the part of a woman desperately in love with a man who is married to another. Slowly but surely, her obsession grows until, at the very climax, she kills the other woman and the poor, broken hearted widower seeks solace in her arms. It’s a musical comedy. </p>
  
__If asked how well you knew Ginger say:__
<p>  I didn’t know Ginger at al. I’ve only met her once, and she was already dead then. Of course, I know everything _about_ her, dahling. Gray’s told me every detail of their fine romance – poor me!  But I have not had the pleasure myself. Shame. She sounded like such a sweet kartoffel. </p>


<h2> Act Two – The Scene </h2>
 
__If asked about the love poems you gave Gray, if you're INNOCENT say:__
<p> It was a whole book of poems that I wrote for Gray. I had a silly crush on him once, long ago. When he got engaged, I asked for it back. I wouldn’t want such gems to be lost for ever: “The boy stood on the burning deck, his leg was all a quiver. I kissed him quick, it made him sick – cirrhosis of the liver.” </p>

__If asked about the love poems you gave Gray, if you're GUILTY say:__
<p> It was nothing, just a silly token of affection. A joke gift I once gave to Gray. Naturally, I didn’t want Ginger to read it and get the wrong idea so I slipped into Gray’s study earlier to retrieve it. It was a good thing I did. It contained some truly awful poetry:  “The boy stood on the burning deck, his leg was all a quiver. I kissed him quick, it made him sick – cirrhosis of the liver.” </p>

__If asked whether you’ve been in Gray’s kitchen say:__
<p> Actually, I have. Thanks to my film premiere, I arrived here late so I slipped in through the servants’ entrance. Chef told me everyone was watching Farley’s movie so I went straight to the projection room. I’m a sucker for the big screen. </p>


<h2> Act Three – The Secret </h2>

__If asked if you have feelings for Gray say:__
<p> Of course I do, dahling! I adore him. But then, doesn’t everybody? Ginger didn’t know how lucky she was. To be engaged to such a handsome, rich, debonair bachelor? It’s what every girl dreams of. It reminds me of this line from  my latest movie: “I could always trust him to hang up my coat. Lean on him whilst I pulled up my stockings. Turn to him for an umbrella in the rain. I loved that hat stand, like nobody’s business.” </p>

__If asked where you were at the time of the murder, if you’re INNOCENT say:__
<p> I was in the projection room, watching Farley Hatpin’s movie – although I missed the beginning. I could have played the leading lady, but I refused to wear the moustache. </p>
  
__If asked where you were at the time of the murder, if you’re GUILTY say:__
<p> I was in the library. Someone mentioned they’d see Ginger there and I wanted to go introduce myself. But when I got there, she’d already left. So I sat there and browsed through a few books by D H Lawrence. He’s obsessed by sword fights, isn’t he? That’s where I was when I heard they’d found the body. “And there she was, cold as ice and twice as pretty, even in death she was prettier than me. At least, I smelled better.” Sorry, I’m quoting from my film again.  </p>


<h2> End Game </h2>

__If you're INNOCENT say:__
<p>I know you’d like to cast me as some tragic, jealous victim of unrequited love but I was happy for Gray and Ginger. He was my best friend – why would I want to hurt him by killing the woman he loved? And so publicly? </p>

__If you're GUILTY, wait until last to say:__
<p> Gray Catsby and I have been close for years. So naturally, I thought that one day we would fall in love, get married, and have two perfect children and a nanny. Then Ginger came along and stole my future. Perhaps I immersed myself too deeply in my latest role. Or perhaps I’m just crazy in love. Either way, killing Ginger was the only thing that made sense. I stole an ice pick as I passed through the kitchen and made my way upstairs. I knew a girl like Ginger would want to freshen up before dinner and sure enough, just after five, she did. We “bumped into each other” in the dining room – but there was not time to chat before I stabbed her with the ice pick and stuffed her into the dumbwaiter. Then I retrieved the book of poems from Gray’s study. I didn’t want that lying around, giving away my mother – but somehow you knew about it anyways. So I guess I’m going to be behind bars for my next role. I think this line sums it up best: “You can take the girl out of prison, but you can’t take the prisoners out of the …” Actually I think I’ve got that wrong. Line? Line anyone?   </p>
