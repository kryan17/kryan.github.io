<h1> Greta Garbled Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Greta’s Bio </h3>
<p>Who is Greta Garbled? A doting wife, a spy, a femme fatale? You play so many roles, the real Greta has been somewhat lost. But one thing’s for sure- you’re always glamorous, always mysterious, and always just out of reach.. you’re so Hollywood, dahling, they might as well change the name to Gretawood!  </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>
<p>Dahlings, please, let’s not make a fuss. Yes, I’m Greta Garbled – famous star of the silver screen. I was in the area to attend the premiere of my latest film, “The Maltese Icepick”, so naturally I had to visit my dear, dear friend ray Catsby. We’ve known each other for years. Poor Gray! Ginger seemed like such a well kid. “Maybe she had it coming, maybe she didn’t – but it had turned up nonetheless and it was everywhere.” That’s a line from my film. </p>

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>
<p>You live a lonely existence, courted by many, cared for by few. Only Gray Catsby looked after you, which is why you are so hopelessly smitten with him…  </p>


<h2> Act One – The Script </h2>
__If asked what your film is about say:__
<p>I play the part of a woman desperately in love with a man who is married to another. Slowly but surely, her obsession grows until, at the very climax, she kills the other woman and the poor, broken hearted widower seeks solace in her arms. It’s a musical comedy. </p>
  
__If asked how well you knew Ginger say:__
<p>  I didn’t know Ginger at al. I’ve only met her once, and she was already dead then. Of course, I know everything _about¬_ her, dahling. Gray’s told me every detail of their fine romance – poor me!  But I have not had the pleasure myself. Shame. She sounded like such a sweet kartoffel. </p>
