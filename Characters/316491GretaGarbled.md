<h3> Greta’s Bio </h3>

But one thing’s for sure- you’re always glamorous, always mysterious, and always just out of reach.. you’re so Hollywood, dahling, they might as well change the name to Gretawood!  </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>
<p>Dahlings, please, let’s not make a fuss. Yes, I’m Greta Garbled – famous star of the silver screen. I was in the area to attend the premiere of my latest film, “The Maltese Icepick”, so naturally I had to visit my dear, dear friend ray Catsby. We’ve known each other for years. Poor Gray! Ginger seemed like such a well kid. “Maybe she had it coming, maybe she didn’t – but it had turned up nonetheless and it was everywhere.” That’s a line from my film. </p>

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>
<p>You live a lonely existence, courted by many, cared for by few. Only Gray Catsby looked after you, which is why you are so hopelessly smitten with him…  </p>
