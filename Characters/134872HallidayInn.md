<h1> Halliday Inn Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Halliday’s Bio </h3>

<p>You’ve been raised to always expect the best things in life. Diamonds for Christmas, a pony for your birthday, everything you could ever want provided by your rich, doting daddy- mainly because he feels guilty about the string of new wives and step-children he keeps brining home. Still, as long as the presents continue, you’re happy to forgive his little mistakes.   </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>

<p> Well, isn’t this a fun caper?! Who’d have thought a boring old charity gala would turn into a murder investigation? How nifty! Oh, forgive me! I completely forgot to intoudce myself. I’m Halliday Inn, a darling of the debutantes and – until recently – heiress to the Inn’s Inns fortune. My Daddy used to own a string of fancy hotels which were ab-so-posi-lute-ly the bee’s knees. I should know- I used to live in one! Now I live with my half-sister, Premya and between you and me, her place is the pits. </p>

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>

<p> Your daddy sold the Inn’s Inn chain to Gray Catsby, who bought it on the insistence of Ginger…  </p>


<h2> Act One – Inn Sider Training </h2>

__If asked what happened to Inn’s Inns, say:__

<p> My Daddy sold them all- can you believe it!? With not so much as a ‘by-your-leave’! Those hotels were my livelihood, how am I supposed to afford pretty dresses and fancy jewelry and parties now? Daddy knows darn well I’m too idle to work but did he think of that? Nooooo. He just sold out to the highest bidder and left me HOMELESS in the process.  </p>
  
__If asked who bought the hotel chain say:__

<p>Didn’t you know? Daddy sold the Inn’s Inns empire to Gray Catsby, who apparently only bought it ebcasue Ginger wanted a choice of where to go on their honeymoon. Well, that’s what I heard anyways, though Ginger tried to tell me it was an “investment” and she had big plans for turning them into a string of ritzy health spas. Health spas? Who’d want to go to one of those?!  </p>
