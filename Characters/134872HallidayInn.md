<h1> Halliday Inn Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Halliday’s Bio </h3>

<p>You’ve been raised to always expect the best things in life. Diamonds for Christmas, a pony for your birthday, everything you could ever want provided by your rich, doting daddy- mainly because he feels guilty about the string of new wives and step-children he keeps brining home. Still, as long as the presents continue, you’re happy to forgive his little mistakes.   </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>

<p> Well, isn’t this a fun caper?! Who’d have thought a boring old charity gala would turn into a murder investigation? How nifty! Oh, forgive me! I completely forgot to intoudce myself. I’m Halliday Inn, a darling of the debutantes and – until recently – heiress to the Inn’s Inns fortune. My Daddy used to own a string of fancy hotels which were ab-so-posi-lute-ly the bee’s knees. I should know- I used to live in one! Now I live with my half-sister, Premya and between you and me, her place is the pits. </p>

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>

<p> Your daddy sold the Inn’s Inn chain to Gray Catsby, who bought it on the insistence of Ginger…  </p>


<h2> Act One – Inn Sider Training </h2>

__If asked what happened to Inn’s Inns, say:__

<p> My Daddy sold them all- can you believe it!? With not so much as a ‘by-your-leave’! Those hotels were my livelihood, how am I supposed to afford pretty dresses and fancy jewelry and parties now? Daddy knows darn well I’m too idle to work but did he think of that? Nooooo. He just sold out to the highest bidder and left me HOMELESS in the process.  </p>
  
__If asked who bought the hotel chain say:__

<p>Didn’t you know? Daddy sold the Inn’s Inns empire to Gray Catsby, who apparently only bought it ebcasue Ginger wanted a choice of where to go on their honeymoon. Well, that’s what I heard anyways, though Ginger tried to tell me it was an “investment” and she had big plans for turning them into a string of ritzy health spas. Health spas? Who’d want to go to one of those?!  </p>


<h2> Act Two – Inn Trouble </h2>
  
__If asked if you’ve been in the kitchen, if you're INNOCENT say:__
<p> Do I look like the sort of person who spends time in a kitchen? I mean, the smell alone is enough to put me off. I can’t imagine what they’ve been cooking in there today but it smelled like they were roasting a homeless raccoon that had died from eating too much cabbage.  </p>

__If asked if you’ve been in the kitchen, if you're GUILTY say:__
<p> You bet I have! I don’t touch alcohol so I ordered a coffee instead and it tasted like pigswill and chocolate milkshake! Plus it was served in a chipped cup of all things! I had a good mind to get the entire kitchen staff fired but since I couldn’t find anyone to do the firing, I marched down to the kitchen myself, smashed the cup against the wall and demanded another. Which I didn’t get.  </p>

__If asked whether you’ll get any money from the hotel sales say:__
<p> Of course I won’t. By the time Daddy has shuffled off his mortal coil along with that old flapper Marie, his fourth wife, there’ll be nothing left to inherit.  </p>


<h2> Act Three – Inn The Drink </h2>
__If asked why you argued with Ginger, if you’re INNOCENT say:__

<p> Oh that! Well, I told her she was playing with a whole family legacy by turning our hotel chain into health spas and she said she could change them into roadside cafes if she felt like it, once she was married to Catsby. </p>
  
__If asked why you argued with Ginger, if you’re GUILTY say:__

<p> Oh that! Well, it wasn’t about Inn’s Inns. Apparently, Chef Cleaver told Ginger about my little “tantrum” and she wasn’t happy. She said I had no right to reprimand her staff. Well, actually, the kitchen staff are employed by Catsby, not Ginger, but that wouldn’t be the first time she’s claimed ownership of something that wasn’t hers, would it?   </p>

__If asked when the argument took place say:__

<p> Not between 5 and 6pm, if that’s what you’re thinking. In fact, when Ginger was killed, I was out cold in the laundry room after drinking a few too many Cinzano and Limes. The freshly washed linen smelled just like my old bed so I couldn’t resist curling up in it- even though it did have a much lower thread count. I didn’t see anyone else there though which I suppose isn’t the most copacetic of alibis.  </p>

<h2> End Game </h2>

__If you're INNOCENT say:__

<p> I wasn’t happy about Gray and Ginger buying out Inn’s Inns but what could I do about it? Killing either one of them wouldn’t have changed anything and really, murder is such a lot of effort. I’ve been told I have a model’s face so I might do that, or become a movie star.  </p>

__If you're GUILTY, wait until last to say:__

<p> I don’t usually murder people because, you know, it’s too much effort. It’s far easier to just spread some vicious rumors if you want to get even with someone. But Ginger didn’t really leave me much choice, did she? Making Daddy sell all his pretty hotels and making me homeless, just for some silly whim about opening some health spas. To be clear, I don’t blame Gray at all – it wasn’t his fault she had him wrapped around her little finger. Ginger may have fooled everyone else into thinking she was sweet as berries but she didn’t fool me! Anyways, I couldn’t get the hotels back, but I could teach her a lesson, so I made up an excuse about the coffee tasing bad to go to the kitchen and look for a weapon. I was thinking of a knife, but then I saw the ice pick so I took that instead. I confronted her in the dining room. Faces were scratched, nails were broken – then she tripped over my foot and fell in the dumbwaiter, so I just stabbed her and left. I said I was passed out in the laundry room when Ginger was killed but I’d completely forgotten about saying I don’t drink. Oh well. Do they have Egyptian cotton in jail?  </p>
