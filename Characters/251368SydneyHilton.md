<h1> Sydney Hilton Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Sydney’s Bio </h3>

<p> Your mother was a writer and your father was head of a global consortium. Consequently, you spent a lot of your childhood in a big empty mansion playing by yourself. Luckily, you had no end of dolls to keep you company. Now you’re too old for dolls, so you’ve had to find something else to be your emotional crutch. </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>

<p> I’m Sydney Hilton, the original BYT – that means Bright Young Thing for all you wet blankets! If it’s in fashion, I’m either wearing it, doing it, or drinking it. But you must excuse my black armband. I’m in mourning for my beloved Gregory. It’s only been a year and I still grieve for him with all my heart. Oh, and it’s a terrible shame about Ginger. I wish we’d had the change to sort things out. Now it’s too late. </p>

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>

<p> It’s been a year since Gregory was tragically killed in a car accident and Ginger was driving the car…  </p>


<h2> Act One – The Cat’s Me-Ouch </h2>

__If asked who Gregory was say:__

<p> Gregory was the love of my life! We were inseparable from the day we met outside the Oriental Gardens. He was so handsome and loving and sophisticared- not at all how’d you’d expect a stray cat to be. I still can’t believe he’s dead. </p>

__If asked how Gregory died say:__

<p> It wasn’t all Ginger’s faut. She might have been driving her Chrysler too fast but I was the one who chose that moment to cross. Poor Gregory didn’t stand a chance! I can still see his frozen, terrified eyes and the wheel of his mangled little cat pra, slowly spinning in the road. I’m sorry, it’s just too upsetting to talk about. </p>


<h2> Act Two – The Cat’s Pajamas </h2>

__If asked why you sent cat clothes to Ginger, if you're INNOCENT say:__

<p> Well, it sounds silly but Gregory’s outfits were just baby clothes so when I heard Gray and Ginger got engaged, I though maybe she could use them. Call it a peace offering. She didn’t seem that pleased though. I don’t know why. His blue silk pajamas were to die for!  </p>

__If asked why you sent cat clothes to Ginger, if you're GUILTY say:__

<p> After the accident, I was in a very dark place. I blamed Ginger entirely. So I sent her Gregory’s clothes, along with some photographs of him wearing them. She just thought they were funny and showed them to everyone she knew. Soon, people were calling him ‘Frumpy cat.” His outfits weren’t frumpy! They were very stylish. </p>

__If asked whether you killed Ginger to get revenge say:__

<p> That’s baloney! We might have fallen out after the accident, but I forgave her a long time ago. I mean, why would I be here if we weren’t friends? Ginger wouldn’t have invited me if there were any bad feelings between us. </p>


<h2> Act Three – The Cat’s Whiskers </h2>

__If asked about your alibi say:__

<p> I don’t’ need an alibi. I was in the trophy room at the time of the murder. Gray’s collection of stuffed animals is quite impressive. He has a gopher which, I swear, has fur that feels just like Gregory’s if you close your eyes and use your imagination. I sat there for I don’t know how long, just stroking, and purring, and making little meowy sounds. It was like he’d come back to me. </p>

__If asked whether you’ve been to the kitchen, if you’re INNOCENT say:__
<p>No, absolutely not! I had no reason to. I’m a guest here – why would I need or even want to go into the kitchen? I mean, that’s why we have staff, isn’t it? I don’t think I even know where the kitchen is. Or what one looks like…  </p>
  
__If asked whether you’ve been to the kitchen, if you’re GUILTY say:__
<p>I did step into the kitchen earlier, just for a moment, but I swear I didn’t take anything. I had to ask Chef to accommodate one extra for dinner, on account of my unexpected arrival. I didn’t stick around though- he was about as happy as a penguin in a steam room and he told me to scram, so I scrammed.  </p>


<h2> End Game </h2>

__If you're INNOCENT say:__

<p> Ginger killed Gregory and although I’ll never be able to forget, I’ve forgiven her. I know nothing will bring him back -no, not even cold-blooded murder. Not even ancient Indian burial grounds. Not even taxidermy. I’ve tried them all. Sorry, I got waylaid. I didn’t kill her.  </p>

__If you're GUILTY, wait until last to say:__

<p> Ginger Whiskers was a cold-hearted, cold-blooded, basic flapper. She showed absolutely no remorse for killing Gregory. According to her, he was “just a cat” and I should simply get a new one. As if I could walk down any random alleyway and find another cat! Anyway, I lied about her inviting me here today. WE weren’t speaking, so there’s no way she would have invited me. But I knew she and Gray would be too polite to turn me away if I just showed up. I had to go to the kitchen to ask Chef to prepare an extra meal and while I was there, I spotted the ice pick. Something about the sharp, pointy tip made me think about plunging it into Ginger, so I took it. Then, when Ginger left the library, I followed her upstairs. I demanded an apology for Gregory, but she just laughed at me and I saw red. I grabbed the nearest object, which just happened to be an Egyptian cat figurine, and knocked her on the head with it. She fell into the dumbwaiter, and down came the ice pick. Well, it served her right. You’d think with a name like Ginger she’d have been a bit more sympathetic towards cats. Me-ouch!  </p>
