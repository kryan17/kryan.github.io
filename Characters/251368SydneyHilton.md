<h1> Sydney Hilton Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Sydney’s Bio </h3>

<p> Your mother was a writer and your father was head of a global consortium. Consequently, you spent a lot of your childhood in a big empty mansion playing by yourself. Luckily, you had no end of dolls to keep you company. Now you’re too old for dolls, so you’ve had to find something else to be your emotional crutch. </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>

<p> I’m Sydney Hilton, the original BYT – that means Bright Young Thing for all you wet blankets! If it’s in fashion, I’m either wearing it, doing it, or drinking it. But you must excuse my black armband. I’m in mourning for my beloved Gregory. It’s only been a year and I still grieve for him with all my heart. Oh, and it’s a terrible shame about Ginger. I wish we’d had the change to sort things out. Now it’s too late. </p>

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>

<p> It’s been a year since Gregory was tragically killed in a car accident and Ginger was driving the car…  </p>


<h2> Act One – The Cat’s Me-Ouch </h2>

__If asked who Gregory was say:__

<p> Gregory was the love of my life! We were inseparable from the day we met outside the Oriental Gardens. He was so handsome and loving and sophisticared- not at all how’d you’d expect a stray cat to be. I still can’t believe he’s dead. </p>

__If asked how Gregory died say:__

<p> It wasn’t all Ginger’s faut. She might have been driving her Chrysler too fast but I was the one who chose that moment to cross. Poor Gregory didn’t stand a chance! I can still see his frozen, terrified eyes and the wheel of his mangled little cat pra, slowly spinning in the road. I’m sorry, it’s just too upsetting to talk about. </p>


<h2> Act Two – The Cat’s Pajamas </h2>

__If asked why you sent cat clothes to Ginger, if you're INNOCENT say:__

<p> Well, it sounds illy but Gregory’s outfits were just baby clothes so when I heard Gray and Ginger got engaged, I though maybe she could use them. Call it a peace offering. She didn’t seem that pleased though. I don’t know why. His blue silk pajamas were to die for!  </p>

__If asked why you sent cat clothes to Ginger, if you're GUILTY say:__

<p> After the accident, I was in a very dark place. I blamed Ginger entirely. So I sent her Gregory’s clothes, along with some photographs of him wearing them. She just thought they were funny and showed them to everyone she knew. Soon, people were calling him ‘Frumpy cat.” His outfits weren’t frumpy! They were very stylish. </p>

__If asked whether you killed Ginger to get revenge say:__

<p> That’s baloney! We might have fallen out after the accident, but I forgave her a long time ago. I mean, why would I be here if we weren’t friends? Ginger wouldn’t have invited me if there were any bad feelings between us. </p>


<h2> Act Three – XXX </h2>
__If asked xxx, if you’re INNOCENT say:__
