<h1> Knuckles Baloney Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Knuckles’s Bio </h3>
<p> As a kid, you were constantly chewed out by your parents for having no skills. Then, when you landed a job as an apprentice butcher, they were over the moon. But they didn’t count on that slaughterhouse being run by Bugsy LaBone – a big time crook and restaurant owner. It wasn’t long before you were dicing some choice fresh cuts for Bugsy and moving your way up into the wise guys, running clubs of your own.  </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>
<p>I’m Knuckles Baloney, but you can call me Mr. Baloney. I’m sorry to have witnessed this tragic sequence of events. My car broke down nearby and Mr Catsby was kind enough to extend an invitation o dinner, even though I’ve yet to step in the dining room. I owe him a big favor, so to repay his generosity I’m going to get to the bottom of the Ginger killer case for him. I hope you all got alibis. </p>

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>
<p> Ginger was a dancer at one of your clubs and she left without asking. Escaped, some would say. Luckily you found her here when your car broke down. Lucky for you anyways… </p> 

<h2> Act One – Old Banger </h2>

__If asked how your car broken down say:__

<p> If I knew the answer to that I wouldn’t have called a mechanic, would I? All I know is there was a sound like a gunshot and then the car grinds to a halt. I can’t believe my luck finding this place. I thought I was going to be stuck in the middle of nowhere! </p>
  
__If asked whether you like Catsby Hall, if you’re INNOCENT say:__

<p> It’s a swell digs. I’d like my whole family to move in here but that’s beside the point. I feel very fortunate running into all the people here – Mr. Catsby with his generous nature, and even Ginger had a familiar face. </p>

__If asked whether you like Catsby Hall, if you’re GUILTY say:__

<p> It’s a swell digs. I’d like my whole family to move in here but that’s beside the point. I feel very fortunate running into all the people here – Mr. Catsby with his generous nature, and even Ginger had a familiar face. Catsby Hall seems like a place that’s full of respect which is good. ‘Cos if I see someone disrespecting a place like this or me, why I oughta… </p>

<h2> Act Two – Sophisticats </h2>

__If asked about knowing Ginger say:__

<p> I said the broad had a familiar face and she did. Ginger used to work for me, she was one of my employees. I was surprised to see her here, especially as she didn’t hand in her notice or say goodbye. I think she was surprised to see me too. </p>
  
__If asked what Ginger did for you say:__

<p> She was an amazing dancer at the Cute Kitten, one of my clubs. She brought in a lot of money ‘cos the punters loved her. Got through fishnets like nobody’s business too, doing all those splits. To be honest, I was a bit angry at first. But now she’s dead, I feel all those bitter feelings replaced with, well, other ones.  </p>

<h2> Act Three – Plan C </h2>

__If asked about upsetting Ginger, say:__

<p> Sure, she got upset. I had a little word in her ear about leaving my club without saying goodbye. Now, I’m a fair man, especially as Mr. Catsby had been so generous. I told her that she could return and work for me, or pay me a cool hundred grand. She said even Catsby couldn’t afford that and asked about option three. I told her she didn’t want to know about option three. There’s a plan A, and a plan B. Plan C is never the best plan. It’s pals with option three. </p>
  
__If asked about being in the dining room, if you’re INNOCENT say:__

<p> I don’t know what you’re trying to pin on me, but I haven’t been in the dining room at all. I was watching some ridiculous Farley Hatpin movie in the projection room which ran from half past four to 6pm. Which reminds me, someone needs to fix the sounds in there. Geez, I thought the mechanic would have showed up by now but he’s still not here. Guess I’ll be spending the night. Thanks Mr Catsby. </p>

__If asked about being in the dining room, if you’re GUILTY say:__ 

<p> I was only in the dining room for a New York minute. Ginger wanted to know about option three so I thought I’d go tell her about it face to face but from the look of things, she didn’t like option three either. Other than that I’ve mainly been hanging out in the kitchen talking to that Chef Cleaver guy. He’s got some great stories to tell- and a lot of dirt on Catsby. Did you know Catsby Hall was built on top of an ancient burial ground, without planning permission?   </p>

<h2> End Game </h2>

__If you're INNOCENT say:__

<p> I’m going to be honest with you all. The card did break down but I didn’t expect to see Ginger here. It was like all my Christmases had come at once, since I’d been looking for her anyways. Nobody crosses me and lives, and that’s still the truth. Just this time I didn’t have to do anything at all. </p>

__If you're GUILTY, wait until last to say:__
<p> I killed the broad, yeah. Nobody crosses Knuckles Baloney and gets away with it. Option one, two, three, blah blah blah. The car did break down, that much is true. I just didn’t expect to find Ginger Whiskers here. The look on her face said it all – I can’t believe she kept all that from Catsby. I told her she could come work for me again or pay me a hundred thousand or… pay with her life. She didn’t want to choose any so I picked for her. It was easy to sneak past all you whack jobs and up into the dining room, and shiv’ing her with the ice pick was just like a normal stint in the joint. It was actually Chef Cleaver who gave me the idea to use the ice pick – I don’t think he’s a Ginger lover either. Anyways, if anyone has a problem with it they can tell it to my little friends who are standing outside with machine guns. In the meantime, I suggest you all wrap a paw around the murder weapon so nobody thinks about ratting me out. And get those drinks flowing again. Catsby Hall’s my club now… </p>
