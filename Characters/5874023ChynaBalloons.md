<h1> Chyna Balloons Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Chyna’s Bio </h3>

<p>Born Wedgewood Zeppelin, you were pressured by your parents to follow in their footsteps- as factory workers. But you knew there had to be a better way and sneaking into movie theatres and stage shows told you how. When you weren’t assembling wooden reindeers at the factory, you practiced dance and balloon artistry. Your first show was a big hit and after you picked a new stage name – and paired up with Ginger- your success ballooned. </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>

<p>Hey everyone, I’m Chyna Balloons, Ginger’s best friend and dance partner. We used to perform a lot together in the early days and now I’m just aghast she’s dead. I really wish I could have been there to protect her but I was in the first floor gymnasium at the time, practicing my tassel spinning. You should see those things jiggle – it’s very vaudeville! </p>

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>

<p>You’ve been best friends with Ginger for years, and seeing her about to move on with her life has left you feeling hurt, jealous and a little bit vengeful… </p>



<h2> Act One – Gym Rat </h2>

__If asked about your deadly tassels say:__

<p> Once, just once, I hit a member of the audience with razor sharp tassels and now everyone thinks I’m a crazy killer lady Yes, they’re sharp, but they’re not pointy like an ice pick. They don’t normally fly off but sometimes when I perform, they burst my balloons and it scares me enough to drop ‘em.  </p>

__If asked if you were alone in the gym, if you're INNOCENT say:__

<p> No ,the gardener popped in to ask if there were any more bushes to trim and stayed for an uncomfortably long time- I’m sure he’ll remember my performance. </p>

__If asked if you were alone in the gym, if you're GUILTY say:__

<p>Nobody else was int eh gym. I don’t like people watching me getting in and out of my balloon dress, let alone practicing my tassel work. Now that I think about it, I did hear some sort of commotion down the hall, coming from the dining room. Do you think I heard what happened to Ginger?  </p>


<h2> Act Two – Dibs </h2>

__If asked about dating Catsby, say:__

<p>Yeah, Gray and I had a few dates before he got together with Ginger. We met him at the same time and he took a fancy to me first. I guess if things had turned out differently, I’d be the one looking forward to a millionaire lifestyle and not having to work anymore. Then again, I’d quite possibly be dead now too! </p>
  
__If asked if you’re jealous of Ginger say:__

<p>Come on, who isn’t a little bit jealous of what Ginger had going on? A beautiful lifestyle, a pleasant husband-to-be, a diamond engagement ring to die for- literally. Yeah, the ginger rage got a hold of me a couple of times but we were best friends, I wouldn’t dream of hurting her – although when we were on stage together anything goes. </p>


<h2> Act Three – Misunderstood </h2>

__If asked whether you were arguing with Ginger earlier, say__

<p>  We had a bit of a cat fight earlier but no fur was pulled. I asked her if she was still going to do our act after she got married. I ccan’t do it on my own, who’s going to blow all those balloons and do the whipped cream decorations? She said no, she was going to travel the world with Gray. I guess there are plenty more dangers in the sea, but not like Ginger. She could’ve partnered Fred Astaire. </p>

__If asked about using whipped cream, if you’re INNOCENT say:__

<p> It’s all part of our dance act. We both dance the Charleston whilst I make balloon animals and she decorates them with the whipped cream. At the end we twirl tassels in both hands before finally popping a balloon full of smoke so we can both magically disappear. We mainly do children’s parties. Why, what were you thinking?  </p>
  
__If asked about using whipped cream, if you’re GUILTY say:__

<p> It’s all part of our dance act. If I hadn’t left my tassels at home, I’d show you. We bot hdance the Charleston, whilst I make balloon animals and she decorates them with the whipped cream. At the end we twirl tassels in both hands before finally popping a balloon full of smoke so we can both magically disappear. We mainly do children’s parties. Why, what were you thinking?  </p>

<h2> End Game </h2>

__If you're INNOCENT say:__

<p>It’s true I was jealous of Ginger’s rise in prosperity. And I was annoyed she left our act dead in the water, but I wouldn’t murder her! Never. Besides, I was in the gym like I said, ask Chef Cleaver. </p>

__If you're GUILTY, wait until last to say:__

<p> There may be trouble ahead, at least for me. I think I probably loved Ginger a little more than I let on. Because how could I have done what I did for anything less? Catsby had stolen her from me, for good, and she didn’t care. Our routine was first class and she was leaving all that behind. When I confronted her about it she didn’t care- she was in love and going places, and she’d send me a postcard. Well, this lady’s not for turning. I wasn’t really in the gym, I was in the dining room arguing with Ginger. I gave her the ice pick. I told her she might as well stab me in the heart and get it over with if she was going to leave our friendship to get married. She wouldn’t take it. She laughed at me. Then the anger took hold. I lunged at her. We struggled. Balloons were popped and cream was whipped. When the smoke cleared, Ginger was wearing the ice pick. She fell backwards into the dumbwaiter and, not knowing what to do, I squashed the rest of her in. She’d have made a great contortionist. I’m sorry everyone, I feel I’ve put the dampers on an otherwise super party. Just before you call the police – does anyone want to see me perform my act?   </p>
