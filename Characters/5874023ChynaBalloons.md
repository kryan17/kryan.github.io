<h1> Chyna Balloons Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Chyna’s Bio </h3>

<p>Born Wedgewood Zeppelin, you were pressured by your parents to follow in their footsteps- as factory workers. But you knew there had to be a better way and sneaking into movie theatres and stage shows told you how. When you weren’t assembling wooden reindeers at the factory, you practiced dance and balloon artistry. Your first show was a big hit and after you picked a new stage name – and paired up with Ginger- your success ballooned. </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>

<p>Hey everyone, I’m Chyna Balloons, Ginger’s best friend and dance partner. We used to perform a lot together in the early days and now I’m just aghast she’s dead. I really wish I could have been there to protect her but I was in the first floor gymnasium at the time, practicing my tassel spinning. You should see those things jiggle – it’s very vaudeville! </p>

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>

<p>You’ve been best friends with Ginger for years, and seeing her about to move on with her life has left you feeling hurt, jealous and a little bit vengeful… </p>

__If asked about your deadly tassels say:__

<p> Once, just once, I hit a member of the audience with razor sharp tassels and now everyone thinks I’m a crazy killer lady Yes, they’re sharp, but they’re not pointy like an ice pick. They don’t normally fly off but sometimes when I perform, they burst my balloons and it scares me enough to drop ‘em.  </p>
