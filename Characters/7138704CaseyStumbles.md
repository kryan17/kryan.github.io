<h1> Casey Stumbles Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Casey’s Bio </h3>

<p>In your early life you performed exceptionally well at school and studied business at university. But you’d always wanted to join the Army, so you did. You rose through the ranks quickly and chose a specialty- bomb disposal. To begin with, you were brilliant but you soon realized the enormity of the job role and nerves got the better of you. Nowadays, even walking upstairs with a cup of team seems hazardous, so you’re very, very careful…  </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>

<p>Casey, Casey Stumbles – the butler. I’m happy to do your bidding, but right now I’m attending to a fairly incriminating clean-up job in the dumbwaiter. I was very fond of Ms. Whiskers and it’s with great sadness I’m cleaning up after her for the last time. I did escort her to the dining room around 5pm, as I was making my way to the guest bedroom of Chyna Balloons. A dove had somehow got in and was wreaking havoc. It took me about an hour to squash the little… sweet creature, out of the window. I heard nothing. </p>

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>

<p> Catsby left you a fortune in his Will, but the maid told you she’d found an updated version where you’d both been cut out… </p>


<h2> Act One – When Doves Cry </h2>

__If asked whether the dove was real say:__

<p> Of course the dove was real! Although I spent half the time sneaking up on Ms. Balloon’s boas, as they all looked suspiciously fluffy. By the time I’d finished there were dove feathers everywhere, but I cleaned them up before Ms. Balloons saw anything because I would, wouldn’t I? Being the butler and all. </p>
  
__If asked how you knew the dove was in the room say:__

<p> I spotted two on the sill from the garden. Ms. Balloons had left her windows wide open, as she often does, ahem. So one flew in and the other must have thought better of it. I can’t stand flappy birds. </p>

<h2> Act Two – Accidental Incident </h2>

__If asked about your previous job, say:__

<p>I was a bomb disposal expert in the Army. I served for many years but after a while became skittish and prone to nerves. I’ve never really gotten over it, not since the incident. </p>
  
__If asked about the incident, if you're INNOCENT say:__

<p> I tripped over a few wires and set off a few timers. Trivial things, had they not been connected to deadly explosives. Anyhoo, I was dishonorably discharged and stripped of my rank and pension. Now I’m best at defusing arguments. </p>

__If asked about the incident, if you're GUILTY say:__

<p> It was an accident, I swear! I didn’t mean to do it! Oh, you said incident, not accident. Um, yes, I inadvertently set off a few explosives by falling into them, so I was dishonorably discharged and stripped of my rank and pension. </p>

<h2> Act Three – I See Picks </h2>

__If asked about your inheritance from Catsby say:__

<p> Mr Catsby is a wonderful employer and clearly, at some point, saw it in his heart to bequest me a princely sum upon his death. Sadly, if the maid is to be believed, the Will has been changed and I am no longer in it. Easy come, easy go. I did not ask to be in it and frankly, probably don’t’ deserve to be in it. If you’re trying to make out I killed Ms. Whiskers over an inheritance, you’re truly mistaken. </p>

__If asked whether you’re in possession of an ice pick, if you’re INNOCENT say:__

<p> No. I haven’t been near an ice pick today. I do however keep an extensive inventory of everything at Catsby Hall, and I can confirm that one ice pick is still missing. I suppose I’ll be expected to buy another one now, which is all very well but imagine the looks I’ll get now that everyone knows what has happened here.  </p>
  
__If asked whether you’re in possession of an ice pick, if you’re GUILTY say:__

<p> Yes, and no. I did have one on me as I’d been chopping up ice in the kitchen, but it seems to have gone missing. Yikes, I wonder if it’s the one they found in Ginger’s back!  </p>

<h2> End Game </h2>

__If you're INNOCENT say:__

<p> I would never do harm to Ms. Whiskers or Mr. Catsby. I’m not even sure why I’ve played along with this charade for so long. As I said before, I care not about inheritance and I was busy wrestling a dove at the time of the murder. I am intrigued to see who is capable of such treachery however! </p>

__If you're GUILTY, wait until last to say:__

<p>I’m so sorry. I’m such a klutz. I did escort Ginger to the dining room. She looked a picture- I suppose it made me a little jealous, but I swear I didn’t intend to. I was leaving to sort out the dove problem when I tripped over a rug and fell into her. When I got up I turned around and poor Ginger had fallen into the dumbwaiter and taken quite a bang to the head. I couldn’t revive her. I tried, I really did. And then I panicked. I remember my dishonorable discharge from before. I couldn’t let that happen again. S, I thought I’d try and cover my accident up, by, well, making it look like murder! I took my icepick out and, well, the rest you know. I’m so sorry Mr Catsby, I’m such a fool- can you ever forgive me? Do they need butlers in prison? How did you know it was me? Is it because I said I hadn’t been near the dumbwaiter, even though earlier I said I escorted Ginger to the dining room? Is it because I almost blurted all this out ages ago when I thought you said ‘accident’ not ‘incident’? Oh for shame, I’m useless at everything. Please, someone- take me away?  </p>
