<h1> Toots Mahoney Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> Toot’s Bio </h3>
<p> You started dancing from an early age and showing some talent for it, you joined a chorus line as your first job. You loved it, for a while, but when you kept getting passed over for the stand-out parts you got angry. Fortunately, Knuckles Baloney was intoxicated by your performances and so you worked your way up his organization to run one of his clubs. Perhaps one day you may even take over his role….  </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>
<p> I’m Toots, and I’m the Mahoney to Knuckles’ Baloney. Thank you all for taking us in after our car broke down today. I’m very sorry too for your loss. I was in the kitchen and the dining room around the time of the murder- I think the dumbwaiter runs between them, doesn’t it? I hope that doesn’t make me a suspect! </p>

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>
<p> Ginger was a dancer at one of your clubs and she left without asking. Escaped, some would say. Luckily you found her here when your car broken down. Lucky for you anyways, … </p>


<h2> Act One – Killer Toots </h2>
__If asked why Knuckles calls you killer, say:__
<p> He’s just gassing! I run the Cute Kitten, which is one of his clubs, and he tells people I’m his killer because we make the most money and have the best dance acts. You should all come along and take in a show someday! </p>
  
__If asked whether you dance too, say:__
<p>Well, aren’t you a feisty one! I only do very expensive private dances, for our top customers, but if you put enough drinks in me tonight I’ll Charleston for anyone! </p>

<h2> Act Two – Hi Ho Ginger </h2>
__If asked about knowing Ginger say:__
<p> ‘Course I know Ginger! Sorry, did I not mention that already? Ginger worked with me at the Cute Kitten. Seems like she didn’t want to tell anyone here about her previous career. I Have no idea why that would be – we’re a kosher establishment. WE even do children’s parties on Wednesdays!  </p>
  
__If asked If asked whether Ginger was surprised to see you, if you're INNOCENT say:__
<p> I should say. Her face was a picture! I think the little kitten weas a bit scared. Truth be told, I’d been hoping to tell her what I thought of her for walking out on her job. But seeing the kindness extended to us by Mr. Catsby, and the bottom of a few glasses, it made me go a bit gooey inside so I just gave her a hug.  </p>

__If asked If asked whether Ginger was surprised to see you, if you're GUILTY say:__
<p> She was fine! After all, she didn’t have anything to worry about. Escaping- sorry, leaving the club- that’s all int eh past now. It’s ancient history! I even offered to do a private dance for Catsby in the first floor lounge- you know, as a wedding present- but he didn’t turn up. I’d have been waiting there the whole time if I hadn’t heard screaming and all that racket coming from the dining room. </p>

<h2> Act Three – Dancing On Ice </h2>
__If asked about private dancing for Catsby, if you’re INNOCENT say:__
<p> Sure I did. I told Ginger I’d do it as a wedding present for her. I don’t think Mr. Catsby expected me to do such a thorough performance though. I dragged him into the kitchen for a bit of privacy and picked a routine from my top shelf. I call it, “Tipsy Ballerina on a Hot Tin Roof Drinking Vodka Shots.” It’s worth the price of admission for the singing alone! </p>
  
__If asked about private dancing for Catsby, if you’re GUILTY say:__
<p>I already said I was going to do that, just Catsby never turned up. I don’t’ think Mr. Catsby understands the type of dances I do but I’d picked a routine from my top shelf. I call it, “Tipsy Ballerina on a Hot Tin Roof Drinking Vodka Shots.” It’s worth the price of admission for the singing alone! </p>

__If asked whether you have an ice pick, if you’re INNOCENT say:__
<p>No, I don’t have an ice pick! And I remember something else now. I was in the kitchen drinking between 5 and 6pm, and the dining room shortly after that ‘cos of the screaming. Chef Cleaver saw me in the kitchen too, though he was in and out a lot, if you know what I mean.  </p>

__If asked whether you have an ice pick, if you’re GUILTY say:__
<p> Why would I have an ice pick? It’s not what I’d call a handbag essential. Lipstick, yes. Small handgun, naturally. Ice pick? That’s crazy. Anyways, I remember seeing the ice pick in the kitchen earlier and it was definitely still there after I left, I swear. In fact, I’m sure I saw two or three of them, though that might have been the vodka. </p>

<h2> End Game </h2>

__If you're INNOCENT say:__
<p> Honestly, I probably could have killed Ginger earlier today, just for showing such little respect and leaving my club. I can’t have the other girls thinking they can just walk! But after Mr. Catsby’s warm welcome, and seeing how happy she was, I wasn’t going to lay a finger on her. One of you other schmooks did it. </p>

__If you're GUILTY, wait until last to say:__
<p> Ah, dammit, youv’e got me. I tried to cover it up by saying I was in the longer waiting for Catsby but I’d already said I was in the kitchen and dining room at the time of the murder. When you run a tight-knit dance club like the Cute Kitten you gotta keep your girls in line. Letting one escape without injury sends the wrong message and I already have my hands full trying to run the place even though they’re afraid of me. Imagine what it would be like it they all started to stand up for themselves! So Ginger had to be the messenger. It seems like a lot of people here had some reason or another for killing the poor girl- I just got to her first. I did go up to the first floor under the pretense of dancing for Catsby but that’s about all the truth I’ve told tonight. Finishing the cat’s ninth life was as easy as making ice cubes and the dumbwaiter, well- it’s not so dumb when you can hide a body in it. I just wasn’t counting on it actually being used for dinner- I guess I’m not used to such fancy establishments. Anyway, better get a call in to one of Mahoney’s “cleaners” to sort out this whole mess! </p>
