<h1> Art Deco Character Sheet </h1>

<h3> Art's Bio </h3>
As a boy, your first drawings were of houses, but instead of stick people and bright yellow suns, you drew actual blueprints! You love architecture and art, and as Catsby has always surrounded himself with the finest things, you’ve always surrounded yourself with Catsby. You’ve been friends since you met at boarding school. You’ve yet to marry and have never been seen with a woman on your arm, leading people to believe that perhaps architecture is your only love? 

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>
Arthur Deco, pleased to meet you all. You can call me Art. It’s such a shame, the beautiful curves, the ample frontage, the welcoming entrance. But I suppose I’ll be able to look at the building again when I leave. We architects love Catsby Hall. Such a shame about Ginger though, how awful! I can only imagine how Gray is feeling. I’m busy designing an archway at the moment but I can come over next week to offer assistance if needed? 

<h3> For Your Eyes Only! </h3> 
Gray Catsby made a gentleman’s wager with you- if he wasn’t married by the time he turned 30, he would give you Catsby Hall. You’ve gone out of your way to sabotage his previous relationships, but Ginger proved to be a problem ... 

<h2> Act One – Vertigo </h2>

<b> If asked about Catsby’s fiancée, say: </b>
<p> Which one? Ms. Duvall? I had nothing to do with that. She was standing nextx to me when she fell, but she was flouncing around near a cliff edge- what did she expect? </p>

<b> If asked whether you liked Ginger say: </b>

<p> Who didn’t like Ginger? She was smitten with Catsby and I’ve never seen Gray act like he does around anyone else – aside from Ms. Duvall I suppose. </p>

<h2> Act Two – Cat Napping </h2>

<b> If asked what you were doing between 5pm and 6pm, say: </b>

<p> I believe I was having a cap nap. Gray is such a great host, he always lets me stay in the room with the most comfortable bed, and the conversation in the library had drifted somewhat. Obviously, I can’t prove my whereabouts, unless someone was spying on me? </p>

<b> If asked why someone would spy on you, if you are INNOCENT say: </b>

<p> It’s just a turn of phrase, my dears. Since the subject of Ms. Duvall was brough up earlier, it’s made me feel a little skittish. Almost as though any involvement with the ghastly tragedies befalling Catsby’s previous fiancées makes me a shoe in for this one! </p> 

<b> If asked why someone would spy on you, if you are GUILTY say: </b>

<p> Fine, I was talking to Ginger in the dining room, is that what you want to hear? We were planning a surprise for Catsby but now it’s ruined. Someone’s spying on me though, trying to make it look like I’m guilty. I’m certain someone was lurking outside the dining room while we were talking. </p>

<h2> Act Three – On The Rocks </h2>

<b> If asked about your wager with Catsby, say: </b>
<p> Gray, being the charming and self-assured fellow he is, promised to bequest me Catsby Hall should he not marry by his 30th birthday. It was a one-sided bet whereby I wagered nothing at all. I do love Catsby Hall, and I’ve no idea whether Gray will honor our gentleman’s agreement should the time come, but I wasn’t about to murder someone just to be in the running. It’s bad enough that Ms. Duvall came to that bitter end with me being so very adjacent to her. At least I can safely say I had nothing to do with his previous fiancée’s death- Daisy, that is. Poor Gray, he has the worst luck! </p>

<b> If someone asks whether you were in the kitchen, if you are INNOCENT say: </b>

<p> No, I’m afraid I have been nowhere near the kitchen during my stay. That is where the culinary magic happens and I’m happy to let it stay that way. What would I be doing in the kitchen anyway? Getting an ice pick? </p>

<b> If someone asks whether you were in the kitchen, if you are GUILTY say: </b>

<p>I’m in the kitchen all the time. Chef Cleaver stores all the best Scotch down there and doesn’t bring it out for any old riff-raff! Why, only earlier today, Chef and I were discussing the art gallery I’ve been working on. And before you ask, I like my Scotch without rocks so I’d have no need for an ice pick, although it’s been quite heated in here tonight. </p>

<h2> End Game </h2>
<b> If you’re INNOCENT say: </b>
<p> I am totally innocent. Shame on anyone if they thought it was me. I can see how winning Catsby Hall might have looked like a motive, but I’ve been friends with Catsby probably longer than anyone here. I was pleased he’d finally get to marry after that incident with Ms. Duvall. That’s the last time I’ll play frisbee near a cliff edge, I can tell you. </p>

<b> If you’re GUILTY say: </b>
<p> I’m sorry Catsby old boy, but I’ve gone a bit doo-lally over Catsby Hall. Since he promised to let me have it should he not marry, I’ve been on a bit of a mission. Now I’m thinking about it, there is a strong possibility I may have nudged Ms. Duvall a little bit over that cliff edge. I didn’t kill Daisy though- I think that one was all Ginger. Anyways, I confronted Ginger in the dining room, concocting a sorry tale about how Catsby was cheating on her left, right, and center so she’d leave him. But she didn’t care. Poor, delusional Ginger. She loved Catsby wholeheartedly. So I laughed it off and said I’d been making it all up. And wouldn’t it be fun if she coiled herself up in the dumbwaiter and I ‘served’ her up to Catsby for dinner. With a giggle, she climbed in- she was extraordinarily limber. I was so jealous of Catsby, jealous and greed. I downed my Scotch and swung at her with the ice pick. Poor kitten. And now’s she’s dead. I’m so sorry. Can you ever forgive me Catsby? And is our bet still on for Catsby Hall? </p>
