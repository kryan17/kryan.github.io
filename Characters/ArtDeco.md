You love architecture and art, and as Catsby has always surrounded himself with the finest things, you’ve always surrounded yourself with Catsby. You’ve been friends since you met at boarding school. You’ve yet to marry and have never been seen with a woman on your arm, leading people to believe that perhaps architecture is your only love?
