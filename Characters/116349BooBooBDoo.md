<h1> BooBoo B'Doo Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h3> BooBoo’s Bio </h3>
<p> Your parents really did try to stop you singing incessantly as a child but to no avail. It was so bad they had to save up so you could have singing lessons, but that paid off later in life when you became a cabaret performer and landed a role as Marietta in the operetta Naughty Marietta. You teamed up with Bebop after responding to his advert for a singer in the local paper and, although you’d set your sights on Broadway, you fell head over heels and have followed Bebop ever since. </p>

<h3> Introduction to Read Aloud: </h3>
<p> I’m Booboo B’Doo – singer, songwriter and all-round good-time girl. It was such an honor to be performing at Catsby Hall, but now this terrible event has clouded the evening. When Bebop said he was off for a walk, I decided to fix my make-up in the ladies room downstairs. That’s where I was when Ginger was killed. It’s a good thing too – I hate the sight of blood. And it always takes so long to wash it off, don’t you find? </p>

<h3> For Your Eyes Only </h3>
<p> You’re positive that Ginger has been flirting with Bebop all day and it’s sent you into a jealous rage (again)… </p>


<h2> Act One – Jail Bird </h2>
__If asked about being imprisoned say:__
<p> That was months ago, and I’m totally rehabilitated since they released me yesterday. It was a misunderstanding- some floozie kept showing too much stocking to Bebop so I decided to show her too much microphone stand. She’s fine now of course, and probably only pressed charges because I was right. </p>
  
__If asked if you get jealous much say:__
<p> Of course not darling, I’m a performer and I have total self-control. The trick is, if you feel yourself getting jealous, respond with some kind of physical violence. That way, the jealousy doesn’t get the better of you. </p>

<h2> Act Two – Age Before Beauty </h2>
__If asked about making a donation say:__
<p> You’ll have to take that up with Bebop. As far as I know, we’re in line to be paid for this charity event. I don’t deal with the money side of things, it kills my creative juices and we wouldn’t want that at my age darling. </p>
  
__If asked how old you are, if you're INNOCENT say:__
<p> Well I never, that's a very personal question which I won't be answering. Suffice to say, it took me an hour to fix my make-up and two hours to layer it on this morning. Make of that what you will. I could be 18 and heavily into rouge, or 50 and heavily _under_ rouge. </p>

__If asked how old you are, if you're GUILTY say:__
<p> How dare you! I'm 21 if not a day over. Look at these cheekbones - perfection. I'm not even wearing make-up, that's how naturally beautiful I am. Why, how old do you think I look? Wait. Don't answer that, I may still have to perform later and my eyes will still be red and puffy if you upset me now.</p>

<h2> Act Three – Cat Slapper </h2>
__If asked about slapping Ginger, if you’re INNOCENT say:__
<p> Ginger got a slap because she deserved it. Nobody looks at my man like that, not even me. That said, I had a moment of jealousy and I got over it. It was only a little playful slap, like you might give a kitten you wanted to move from the verandah to the bottom of the garden. Besides, this was all after lunch- and wouldn’t Chef Cleaver have seen me looking for an ice pick in the kitchen if I was the murderer? </p>

It was only a little playful slap, like you might give a kitten you wanted to move from the verandah to the bottom of the garden. Who told you, was it Chef Cleaver? I took Ginger into the kitchen to discuss her misdemeanor in private as I didn’t want anybody else to hear. </p>

__If asked whether Ginger slapped you back say:__
<p> I’ve never had Ginger slaps before and I still haven’t. She went red, made a pouty face at me, and stormed off. Which again proves I was right not to trust her. I don’t know why she got so upset though- I bet she got slapped all the time with a face like that. </p>

<h2> End Game </h2>

__If you're INNOCENT say:__
<p> I’m very sorry for your loss but I had nothing to do with it I’m afraid. Considering how she was making eyes at Bebop it’s probably for the best anyways. Who knows how long a marriage with last nowadays? It’s not like it was in the 19th Century. </p>

__If you're GUILTY, wait until last to say:__
<p> It’s very possible that I still need to work on controlling my anger – but wen I thought I saw Ginger flirting with my husband, the red rage got the better of me. After failing to get her to apologies in the kitchen, I started to look for a weapon and picked up an ice pick which had been conveniently left next to the sink. When Ginger left for the dining room, I followed her. I wasn’t fixing my make-up. I said I didn’t wear any- remember? When I confronted her she laughed in my face and said she had no interest in Bebop and that it was my own self-esteem that needed a slap. I pushed her hard and she fell against the dumbwaiter. I think you all know the rest. I’m not sorry I did it either. That Ginger ninja would have been a home wrecker- if not mine it would have been someone else’s. So you should all be thanking me instead of calling the police. Seriously, put the telephone down. You don’t know what they do to pretty faces like mine in prison, and who’ll look after Bebop when I’m gone…? </p>
