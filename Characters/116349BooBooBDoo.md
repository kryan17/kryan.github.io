<h1> BooBoo B'Doo Character Sheet </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> Your parents really did try to stop you singing incessantly as a child but to no avail. It was so bad they had to save up so you could have singing lessons, but that paid off later in life when you became a cabaret performer and landed a role as Marietta in the operetta Naughty Marietta. You teamed up with Bebop after responding to his advert for a singer in the local paper and, although you’d set your sights on Broadway, you fell head over heels and have followed Bebop ever since. </p>
 

<h3> BooBoo’s Bio </h3>
<p> I’m Booboo B’Doo – singer, songwriter and all-round good-time girl. It was such an honor to be performing at Catsby Hall, but now this terrible event has clouded the evening. When Bebop said he was off for a walk, I decided to fix my make-up in the ladies room downstairs. That’s where I was when Ginger was killed. It’s a good thing too – I hate the sight of blood. And it always takes so long to wash it off, don’t you find? </p>
